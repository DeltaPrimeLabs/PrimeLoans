/**
 * @title SmartLoansFactory
 * @dev Contract responsible for creating new instances of SmartLoans (SmartLoanDiamondBeacon).
 * It's possible to either simply create a new loan or create and fund it with an ERC20 asset as well as borrow in a single transaction.
 * At the time of creating a loan, SmartLoansFactory contract is the owner for the sake of being able to perform the fund() and borrow() operations.
 * At the end of the createAndFundLoan the ownership is transferred to the msg.sender.
 * It's also responsible for keeping track of the loans, ensuring one loan per wallet rule, ownership transfers proposals/execution and
 * authorizes registered loans to borrow from lending pools.

If you're encountering the error message "network does not support ENS" while running tests in Hardhat, it typically indicates that the network you're using in your Hardhat configuration does not have Ethereum Name Service (ENS) support. This can happen if you're using a local Hardhat network or a network that doesn't have ENS integrated.

Here are steps you can take to resolve this issue:

### 1. Use a Supported Network
If you are testing your smart contracts and need ENS functionality, consider using a public test network that supports ENS, such as Rinkeby or Goerli. You can configure your Hardhat project to connect to one of these networks.

### 2. Configure Hardhat to Use a Public Test Network
To configure Hardhat to use a public test network, follow these steps:

- Install the necessary dependencies if you haven't already:

    ```bash
    npm install @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers ethers
    ```

- Update your `hardhat.config.js` to include the desired network. Hereâ€™s an example configuration for using the Goerli test network:

    ```javascript
    require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers');

    module.exports = {
        solidity: "0.8.0",
        networks: {
            goerli: {
                url: "https://goerli.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID",
                accounts: ["YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"], // Use your wallet's private key
            },
        },
    };
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID` with your actual Infura project ID and `YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY` with your wallet's private key (make sure to keep this private).

### 3. Using ENS in Tests
If you want to test ENS functionality, you can use the `@ensdomains/ens` package to create a mock ENS setup in your tests. However, for simplicity, you can also directly interact with the ENS on a public test network.

### 4. Running the Tests
Once you have configured your network, you can run your tests against the specified network:

```bash
npx hardhat test --network goerli
```

### 5. Local Development with ENS
If you still want to run tests locally and need ENS, you can set up a local ENS environment. However, this requires more advanced configuration and is typically not necessary for most testing scenarios. You might consider deploying a mock ENS contract or using a local fork of a network that supports ENS.

### Summary
In summary, to resolve the "network does not support ENS" error in Hardhat tests, switch to a network that supports ENS, such as a public test network like Goerli, and ensure your Hardhat configuration is set up correctly for that network.
